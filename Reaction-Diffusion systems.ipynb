    "Oscillating dynamic systems are fascinating! And omnipresent... No matter your background, you've probably come in contact with oscillators during your studies, be it in a form of an [RLC contour](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RLC_circuit) in your electrical engineering class or in a form of a [circadian clock](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Circadian_clock) in your biochemistry class.\n",

    "Random question #1: what does the Briggs-Rauscher reaction in the video above has to do with the dotted pattern of cheetah and stripy pattern of zebra on the images below? Well, since this question is asked in the tutorial dedicated to oscillators, you might've guessed that the answer should have something to do with the oscillators... And this is indeed true. Although, if the Briggs-Rauscher reaction is an example of a system, that is periodic in time and is perfectly stable (homogenous) in space, the patterns on animal fur, quite the opposite, are examples of a system, that is periodic in space and is perfectly stable in time. The idea that initially homogenous systems can develop spatial patterns (periodicity in space) that stabilize with time, was discussed back in the 1952 by Alan Turing in [Chemical Basis of Morphogenesis](http://www.dna.caltech.edu/courses/cs191/paperscs191/turing.pdf). This seminal paper showed that the formation of many complex spatial patterns can be nicely described by all too familiar maths (and physics)! Which is really good news for anyone, who wants to recreate the formation of such patterns _in silico_.\n",

    "Now you might be thinking: ok, I can picture systems, that are periodic in time and stable (homogenous) in space - they behave like chemical oscillators in a well-stirred beaker; I can also picture systems that are periodic in space and stable in time - these are the systems, that, e.g., describe the formation of patterns on animal fur. But what about the systems that are periodic in both time and space? That's a great thing to wonder about, as diversity of patterns and complexity of behaviours, emerging in such systems, is mind-boggling! In literature you would usually find mentions of spirals, standing waves and packet waves, which often emerge in such systems. In physical world these patterns occur, e.g., in a petri dish with [Belousov-Zhabotinsky](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Belousov%E2%80%93Zhabotinsky_reaction) reaction. But there's so much more to it! In autocatacytic Reaction-Diffusion system described by the Gray-Scott model you can stumble upon dynamic patterns that resemble cell division, coral growth and even the formation of exotic [U-skates](http://mrob.com/pub/comp/xmorphia/uskate-world.html)! Robert Munafo's [xmorphia](http://mrob.com/pub/comp/xmorphia/index.html) is a great resource to explore all the bizzare patterns that emerge in Gray-Scott system. Here are some examples:\n",

Instead we will learn how to set up such systems from scratch in python and how to systematically search for interesting patterns.

I will also assume that people reading this still remember bits and pieces from Calculus and Linear Algebra, but wouldn't mind a recap.

    "Systems that change over time are classically described by differential equations, that reflect conservation of some property of the system: at any point in time all the stuff that goes into the box must go out of the box, it doesn't spontaneously emerge or disappear into the void. Simple. \n",

    "Fine, at any point in time all the stuff that goes into the box must balance out the stuff that goes out of the box and reacts away inside the box (also, for general accounting purposes, we should write a similar balance for the \"other stuff\", which is now generated inside the box). \n",
    "\n",
    "_Ok ok, but what if the box has a capacity to build up and release some reserve of stuff?_ \n",
    "\n",
    "Fine! Any stuff that comes in and is not balanced out by going out and reacting away, is accumulated inside the box!\n",

    "\n",
    "Easy. We'll just pretend that our box is composed of several smaller compartments connected in series. Concentration of stuff inside each compartment can be homogenous, but, as long as the number of such compartments is sufficiently high, this __tanks-is-series__ model should approximate the original system well.\n",

This model might be acceptable to describe the flow of water through long narrow pipes, but there's no way we can use it to describe the growth of bacteria in a petri dish, where stuff diffuses in all directions... _\n",
    "\n",
    "Ok, __diffusion__ is a bit trickier. Stuff, as expected, diffuses to locations, where its concentration is lower. More specifically, diffusive [flux](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flux) is driven by a concentration gradient - change in concentration per unit of distance ($-\\frac{dc}{dx}$) for those living in the 1D world, or per unit of space ($-\\nabla{c}$) for everyone else (\"$-$\" sign because the flux is _positive_ in the direction along which the concentration _decreases_). If we choose $D$ to be some proportionality constant, characteristic for our stuff and environment through which it diffuses, then we can write the expression for the diffusive flux as:\n",

    "$$ J = -D \\frac{dc}{dx} \\rightarrow J = -D \\nabla{c}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "Flux tells us something about the __direction__ of diffusion, but doesn't tell anything about its __rate__. To get the expression for the rate of concentration change at any point in space, we can speculate, that if there is no chemical reaction, the change of concentration can only be due to flux, so $ \\frac{\\partial c}{\\partial t} + \\frac{\\partial J}{\\partial x} = 0$. If we combine it with the expression for flux, we'll get the proper expression for the diffusion rate, also known as [second Fick's law](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fick%27s_laws_of_diffusion) of diffusion:\n",

    "\n",
    "The only thing left to do now is to figure out how we can adjust this expression to account for reaction. Well, if there _is_ a reaction, then the change of concentration of stuff at any point in space can be explained both by its diffusion from one point to another _and_ by its reaction to \"another stuff\". So we can just _add_ the reaction terms to the Fick's law, taking care of the units:\n",
