It seems assuming linear dependence for
reaction rates wasn't exactly a great idea - 
now our system has enzymes with 
negative concentrations... fantastic...
We can fix it by assuming more realistic nonlinear kinetics, 
but let's not do it just yet. 
After all, we're only trying to build intuition
while playing with simple maths here.
